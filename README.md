# First Things First
Guidance to start learning python programming, especially for YOLO.

### Outline

- Python Virtual Environment (Win 10/11 & Ubuntu 20.04)
- Python Fundamental
- Python Intermediate
- Python Library (Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Seaborn)
- Git
- Github
- Project

In project section, we will try to make repository in GitHub, then try to fork other reository and make a pull request.

*Enjoy Coding Guys*


## Python Virtual Environment (Win 10/11 & Ubuntu 20.04)

In this step, we will use VS Code as code editor, but to be honest I usually use PyCharm as my IDE.
Just watch from this tutorial.

## Python Library (Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Seaborn)
In the last section of previous part, you learnt how to use PIP in python. This tool is very important to install library from [pypi](https://pypi.org/).
There are 4 libraries that will be our most basic and important package: Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas, and Seaborn.

PS: it's not necessary to understand well all those library, just know the basic :)

## Git and Github
This tool is very important to understand well.
